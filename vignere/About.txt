About 
1) we take string input and key
2) key size is matched to input string
3) every charater a-z ,A-Z is mapped 0-25 in this program
4) Encoding :
   1) encrypted[i]=(original[i]+key[i])%26 , (I have taken care of cases when original[i] is upper ,lower along with key[i] is lower or upper ) if upper case 
   is present at original[i] then encrypted string will get corresponding upper case , same for lower case
5)decoding
    1)decrypted[i]=(endcrypted[i]-key[i]+26)%26
    2) same conditons for upper lower case is also present in decoding step

constraints
1)only alphabets are allowed in both key and string
2) length of string and key is not bounded

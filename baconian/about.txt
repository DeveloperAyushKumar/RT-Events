constraints 
 i) key must be an integer k [5,32]
 ii) input string can contain only lower case alphabets
 iii) No restriction on length of input string

Fuctioning :
i) input : a message ,a key k (int)
ii) logic :each charater of input string is mapped a->0,z->25 , these mapped number are converted to their binary form(of k bit ) , then 1 is repersentd
by r ,and 0 by t and corresponding binary form is converted in string format 
e.g b->1->00001->ttttr (k=5)
